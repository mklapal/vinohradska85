						The binding reservation means the signing of the Reservation Contract, after which the Future Seller agrees to take off the property of the market. The Reservation Contract commits the Buyer to pay the reservation fee amount of CZK 200.000,- within 5 (five) working days from the signing of this contract. This contract commits both parties to conclude the Pre-purchase Contract. If Purchase Contract is concluded, the reservation fee is deducted from the purchase price.
					</p>
					
					<h2>
						THE PRE-PURCHASE CONTRACT (Future Purchase Contract)
					</h2>
					<p>
						The Pre-purchase Contract will be signed after a final inspection of the units. When signing the Pre-purchase Contract, the Buyer has to provide the Seller with his way of financing the property and paid another instalment of 15% of the purchase price. The remaining part of the purchase price has to be paid by the Buyer onto the escrow account. The Escrow Contract is signed together with the Pre-purchase Contract.
					</p>

					<h2>
						PURCHASE CONTRACT
					</h2>
					<p>
						Within 30 days from signing of the Pre-purchase Contract is signed the Purchase Contract. Before the signing of this contract, the Buyer is obliged to pay the remaining part of the purchase price onto the escrow account.
